# Modupdate
I wanted to download things from curseforge automatically but this was not so easy.
There were not many scripts online that I could go to for guidance, so I'm putting this up to maybe help people.

# Usage
I hope that this is understandable.
- Run "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install the required packages.
- Create a new Minecraft instance and install Forge/Fabric.
- Place the modupdate.py file in your ".minecraft" directory.
- Edit the versionparam dictionary with your desired version. (this may be found inside of modupdate.py) (Weight more desirable parameters with larger numbers)
- Make a sacrafice to the number gods to boost your chances of success.
- Run the thing!

# To Do
- Manual version specification
